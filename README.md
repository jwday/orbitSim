# orbitSim
Python-based simulation to model decaying orbit of a 3U CubeSat. Was used in an attempt to estimate the orbital lifetime of a 3U CubeSat in LEO.
Various atmospheric models were integrated (including MSISE00) in order to estimate drag, and variations to mass, starting altitude, and average exposed surface area were also attempted.
Ultimately, the results were found to be too variable and did not agree well with the (limited) available real data, so the project was scrapped.

I will still attempt to clean this up for the sake of presentation, but for now, the work is presented here "as-is".

Please reach out if you have any questions.
